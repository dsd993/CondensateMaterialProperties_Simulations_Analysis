These set of files can be used to run the NEMD simulations to compute viscosity.  The example set of 
files given here are for the LAF1-WT protein (150 chains), simulated using the HPS-Urry model, at one 
of the shear rates used in this work.  See LAF1RGG_Variant2.dat file for the sequence of LAF1-WT.

Initial coordinate file --> eqconf_V2.data

Final coordinate file --> finalconf_NEMD_V2.data
