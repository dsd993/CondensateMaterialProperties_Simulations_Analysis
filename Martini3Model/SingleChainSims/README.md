These set of files can be used to run the single chain simulations for computing radius of gyration.  
The example set of files given here are for the diblock E-K sequence (1 chain), simulated using the Martini 3 model.  See 
EKV_15.dat file for the sequence of diblock E-K.

File details:

Initial coordinate file --> min.gro

Final coordinate file --> NpT_s608129.gro

Topology file --> PRO_topol_SOL_IONS.top

GROMACS input script file --> md_Martini.mdp

Command used to compute the radius of gyration from slab simulations: "gmx gyrate" within the GROMACS software package.
